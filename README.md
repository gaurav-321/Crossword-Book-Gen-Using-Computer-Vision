# Crossword Book Generator 🎯

Crossword Book Generator is a Python program that leverages Flask, OpenCV (cv2), and random to create custom crossword puzzle books. It provides an interactive web interface for users to upload CSV files and media, process the data, and generate output in PDF format.

## ✨ Description

This project aims to simplify the creation of crossword puzzle books with a user-friendly web interface. By using Flask as the backend framework, OpenCV for image processing, and random for dynamic content generation, it allows users to easily create custom crossword puzzles based on their input data.

## 🚀 Features

- **Flask Web Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for uploading CSV files and media.
- **Image Processing**: Utilizes OpenCV to handle background selection and font styling.
- **CSV Parsing**: Extracts crossword clues and solutions from uploaded CSV files.
- **Dynamic PDF Generation**: Generates custom crossword puzzle books in PDF format based on user input.
